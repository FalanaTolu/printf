# Documentation for Project 0x11. C - printf

**This file is mandatory in all ALX School projects**


This was a team project done by *Tolu Falana* and *Abdulbaqi Adekomi*.


This project was basically the recreation of the *printf* function in C programming language, from the scratch. It involved creating a *printf* function that could accept several arguments, including format specifiers and that could write to stdout.
